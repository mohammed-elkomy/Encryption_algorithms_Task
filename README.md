# Encryption_algorithms_Task

This is my personal assignment for cryptography task.

## RSA

Contains modest biginteger implementation using vectors as blocks of numbers, I tried multiplying numbers as repeated addition in logarithmic complexity(divide and conquer) of the number space :D 
as well as modular exponentiation as repeated multiplcation with logarithmic complexity (divide and conquer), divion as binary search :D also as (divide and conquer).. that was fun :D .

I also implemented the extended GCD and modulo-inverse for establishing RSA communication.

## PlayFair

Implemented as 2 indexed data structures for fast retrieval.

## rail-fence cipher 
Implemented efficiently by applying an index.
